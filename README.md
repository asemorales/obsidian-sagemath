# Obsidian SageMath Integration
Plugin to create and run SageMath cells inside Obsidian.

## Building for local development
To build and run this plugin, clone this repo into `.obsidian/plugins`. Inside the root folder, run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
It is recommended to use the [Hot Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin during development for live changes.

## Acknowledgements
This plugin is a continuation of the excellent work done in [obsidian-sage](https://github.com/Exr0nProjects/obsidian-sage) and [obsidian-sagecell](https://github.com/EricR/obsidian-sagecell). It was created to provide a maintained version of these tools now that development on the original versions have paused.
